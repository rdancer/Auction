USAGE

There are two programs:

    (1) Client.java -- the client program
    (2) Server.java -- the server program


Run them like this:

    java Client <HOST> <PORT> <CLIENT_ID>
    java Server <PORT>

You can run many clients in parallell connecting to the same HOST:PORT, i.e. to
the same server.  Multiple clients can share one CLIENT_ID.
